	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate opacity of discrete event systems. We define two types of opacities: strong opacity and weak opacity. Given a general observation mapping, a language is strongly opaque if all strings in the language are confused with some strings in another language and it is weakly opaque if some strings in the language are confused with some strings in another language. We show that security and privacy of computer systems and communication protocols can be investigated in terms of opacity. In particular, two important properties in security and privacy, namely anonymity and secrecy, can be studied as special cases of opacity. We also show that by properly specifying the languages and the observation mapping, three important properties of discrete event systems, namely observability, diagnosability, and detectability, can all be reformulated as opacity. Thus, opacity has a wide range of applications. Also in this paper we provide algorithms for checking strong opacity and weak opacity for systems described by regular languages and having a generalized projection as the observation mapping.},

The first step to diagnose failure occurrences in discrete event systems is the verification of the system diagnosability. Several works in the literature have addresses this problem using either diagnosers or verifiers for the centralized and decentralized architectures. In this paper a new polynomial time algorithm to verify the decentralized diagnosability property of a discrete event system is proposed. The algorithm has lower computational complexity than other methods proposed in the literature and can also be applied to the centralized case.},

For this purpose, we present a methodology that builds the complete model of a system by composing models of the individual hardware components, their physical coupling, and the associated control logic. We choose to employ a hierarchical decomposition that separates the control logic into a high level that manages the sequence of control actions and a low level that implements the control actions. The low level is composed of control logic and physical components (sensors and actuators) grouped into a device. In order to capture the physical constraints between the components in a device, we propose the notion of a physical constraint automaton, which is composed with the generic component automata to generate the complete model of the device. We also show how the methodology allows the introduction of component faults into the overall model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a micro flexible manufacturing system.},

	abstract = {The problem of decentralized modular fault diagnosis of concurrent discrete event systems, that is composed of a set of component modules, is formulated and studied. In the proposed decentralized modular framework, diagnosis is performed by the local diagnosers, located at the component sites, using their own local observations. This is to ensure the scalability of the approach with respect to the number of component modules, and we require that the local diagnosers be ldquomodularly computablerdquo, i.e., their computation should be based on the local models, and not the global models. It is also required that there are no missed-detections (every fault is detected within a bounded number of transitions) and no false-alarms (a fault detection report is issued only when a fault has occurred). We formally define the decentralized modular diagnosis problem and introduce the notion of modular diagnosability as a key property for the existence of desired decentralized modular diagnosers. We show that under this property, the complexity for constructing the local diagnosers is polynomial in the number of local modules. We present a method for testing the modular diagnosability property by reducing it to an instance of a certain codiagnosability property for which known verification techniques exist.},

Algorithms of complexity polynomial in the size of the system and the nonfault specification are provided for: 1) testing codiagnosability, 2) computing the bound in delay of diagnosis, 3) offline synthesis of individual diagnosers, and 4) online diagnosis using them. The notion of codiagnosability and the above algorithms are initially presented in a setting of a specification language (violation of which represents a fault) and are later specialized to the case where faults are modeled as the occurrences of certain events. The notion of strong codiagnosability is also introduced to capture the ability of being certain about both the failure as well as the nonfailure conditions in a system within a bounded delay.},

For example, this constraint could be required to prevent local faults from developing into failures that could cause safety hazards. This idea results in a new language property for discrete event systems called safe diagnosability. Necessary and sufficient conditions to test this language property are presented. Moreover, the problem of explicitly taking into account safe diagnosability as a requirement in system design is discussed.},

We analyze the diagnostic properties of each protocol. We also state and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a language to be diagnosable under each protocol. These conditions are checkable off-line. The online diagnostic process is carried out using the diagnosers introduced in the above article or a slight variation of these diagnosers. The key features of the proposed protocols are: (i) they achieve, each under a set of assumptions, the same diagnostic performance as the centralized diagnoser; and (ii) they highlight the performance vs. complexity tradeoff that arises in coordinated decentralized architectures. The correctness of two of the protocols relies on some stringent global ordering assumptions on message reception at the coordinator's site, the relaxation of which is briefly discussed},
